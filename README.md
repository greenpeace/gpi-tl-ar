Techlab team have been exploring using Augmented Reality as a widely deployable engagement tool. Thanks to the phones many of us carry and cross-platform web technologies ([ThreeJS](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/) and [AR.js](https://github.com/jeromeetienne/AR.js/blob/master/README.md)) it's possible to use a web browser to explore a 3D scene projected into your environment using your smart phones built-in browser.

This month we have created a demo showing how a user can use their mobile device and a custom Greenpeace AR logo to explore the impact of their lifestyle on the environment by creating a mythical landscape that scales with their individual impact.
